# Lab 2 Log
This is the log for Lab 2.

## Task 1

For task 1 I only encountered the issue of having the increment set too high as the VBuddy rotary encoder pertains its value between simulation runs.
If it's set too high (80+) it overflows and causes multiple sinewaves to form.
Below you can see the trace generated by the simulation.

## Task 2

Task 2 went pretty smoothly with no issues encountered, making the dual port ROM was not a drastic adjustment as well as adding another output to the sinewave generator.
I had to modify the testbench to account for these changes in the simulated hardware modules.
Below I've included the trace generated by the simulation (which is also plotted on VBuddy).

## Task 3 

Task 3 also was okay but I did have to change the RAM_SZ in the testbench from 8 to 1 for it to work (otherwise the delay was too high.
Below you can see the trace of the normal and delayed signal (the delay was varried throughout.

Here is a specific snippet which shows the effect well.
