# Lab 2 Log
This is the log for Lab 2.

## Task 1

For task 1 I only encountered the issue of having the increment set too high as the VBuddy rotary encoder pertains its value between simulation runs.
If it's set too high (80+) it overflows and causes multiple sinewaves to form.
Below you can see the trace generated by the simulation.
